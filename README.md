## Features

- **Multiple Selection Criteria**: Choose from three distinct methods to determine game winners:
  1. **Random Picks**: Winners are selected randomly for each game.
  2. **Zip Code Criterion**: The team with the lowest last three digits of its home arena zip code wins.
  3. **Pantone Color Criterion**: The team with the highest last two digits of its primary Pantone color wins.

- **Round-by-Round Simulation**: The program displays each tournament round, individual games, and the determined winners based on the chosen criterion.

## Future Improvements

- **Code Optimization**: Reduce code repetition to enhance maintainability and readability.
- **Bracket Visualization**: Implement a feature to display the winner picks in a bracket layout and provide an option to output this layout to a text file for easy sharing and printing.
