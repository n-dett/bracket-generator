# Bracket Generator

A program that selects 2024 March Madness winner picks based on criteria selected by the user.

## Description

The user is asked to select one of three criteria: 1) All random picks, 2) Team with the lowest last three digits of its home arena zip code, or 3) Team with highest last two digits of its primary Pantone color. Each tournament round, game, and game winner is displayed based on the criteria chosen. The user can then use the generated winner picks to fill out their bracket.

## Future Improvements

In the future I would like to eliminate some of the repetition that currently exists in the code. I would also like to display the winner picks in a bracket layout that can be output to a text file.
